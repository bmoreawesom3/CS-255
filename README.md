Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was a good and simple project but had some great aspects to it. The project was headed up by Liam. His company offered a niche experiences to users to practice taking the tests administered by the DMV and also practice driving with real people. The system was broken down by two main functions. Taking tests and scheduling drivers to practrice the tests.

What did you do particularly well?

I thought I handled the creation of the diagrams the best. I have a good understanding of how they should look and feel but also understanding the thought process nehind them.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think I would have reoworked the ghant chart. I felt like it was very robotic in nature and could have had a better layout for the timeline.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Considering the user's needs to second to the owners requests. The user is the one paying the bills for the company. Making sure they have a solid understanding of the UI but also making it so they do not encounter issues and if they do to have a helpful guide to solve their issue.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My first step is to go to the different models types and also start to create the different types of charts. At first I thought there was one chart to rule them all but after creating several of them I can see how they make you think slightly different. It can help you go back and revise charts that you had done. I feel like it gave me the ability to see diferent angles of the project which will make me a better programmer.
